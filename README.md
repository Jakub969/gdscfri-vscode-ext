# GDSC FRI extension

This is a GDSC FRI extension. It is a simple extension which was created on the [GDSC FRI workshop](https://gdsc.community.dev/events/details/developer-student-clubs-university-of-zilina-presents-code-with-jan-amp-bots-how-are-they-detected/).

## What does this extension do?

This extension adds command `GDSC FRI: AUS filter data`, which helps students to check correct answers for their semester project from AUS. Before running  this command, you need to have configured path to your AUS data in the settings - param `gdscfri.aus.pathToVillages`. 

## What's next?

This extension is just a simple example of what you can do with VS Code extensions. Feel free to fork [this repository](https://github.com/jancikos/gdscfri-vscode-ext) and create your own extension. You can find more information about creating extensions in the [official documentation](https://code.visualstudio.com/api).
